Honestly, we are not going crazy… It's just menopause!<p class=pad-bot-m>Menopause is a transitional period when our bodies start to wind down on our reproductive abilities.<p class=pad-bot-m>And it’s no fun ride. All the mood swings, hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, joint pains, and the never-ending list of problems. Feels like we have a lot to deal with, by ourselves.<p class=pad-bot-m>But...<p class=pad-bot-m>Understanding and accepting these symptoms can help us simplify the process of solving them (as promised, as easy as 1, 2, 3)!<p class=pad-bot-m>Let us start with understanding the 3 stages of Menopause:<ol class=ordered-inline-list><li>Perimenopause or Premenopause<li>Menopause<li>Postmenopause</ol></div></section><section class="row pad-bot-l pad-top-l"id=menopause-stages><div class=col><h2 class=pad-bot-m>The 3 Stages of Menopause</h2><article id=perimenopause><h3 class=pad-bot-m>Perimenopause</h3><p class=pad-bot-m>Perimenopause or Premenopause can begin several years before menopause. This could last between a few months to about 10 years. However, on average it lasts about 4 years.<h4 class=pad-bot-m>What happens?</h4><h5 class=pad-bot-m>Ovaries start to gradually lower estrogen production.</h5><p class=pad-bot-m>This is a natural process of growing older and usually starts around the age of 40. In some cases, it could start as early as when women are in their 30s.<p class=pad-bot-m>This could mean a reduction in our fertility rate, therefore, women looking to start a family should try and utilize every open opportunity with their partner!<h5 class=pad-bot-m>Changes in the menstrual/period cycle</h5><p class=pad-bot-m>The horror stories begin with the change in duration of our menstrual cycle- there could be longer gaps between periods or spotting between 2 cycles.<p class=pad-bot-m>Like, the frustration of not knowing when you will get your period next is not enough; the flow would differ too, making it heavier or lighter over time.<h5 class=pad-bot-m>Intensified PMS (premenstrual syndrome)</h5><p class=pad-bot-m>Drastic and frequent mood swings are the most common signals, along with increased insomnia or hot flashes.<p class=pad-bot-m>This could increase our irritability level, losing our energy levels; getting tired even after sitting at work the entire day or taking longer weekend naps to recover from our workweek would be common.</article><article id=menopause><h3 class=pad-bot-m>Menopause</h3><p class=pad-bot-m>The official menopause stage begins 12 months after the last menstrual period (bleeding).<h4 class=pad-bot-m>What happens?</h4><h5 class=pad-bot-m>Ovaries stop releasing eggs.</h5><p class=pad-bot-m>This means there would be minimal production of estrogen.<p class=pad-bot-m>At this stage, getting pregnant could be significantly harder. Hence, we notice the use of hormonal therapy or IVF for childbirth.<p class=pad-bot-m>We start feeling “low”, with the constant need to cuddle in bed and watch Netflix instead of going out and getting drinks with our girlfriends.<h5 class=pad-bot-m>Intensified hot flashes and night sweats.</h5><p class=pad-bot-m>Waking up in the middle of the night, aggressively throwing our blanket away or turning your fan on max even though the aircon is on full blast.<p class=pad-bot-m>Our body starts to feel warm or hot suddenly, with flushed red skin and increased heart rate; followed by suddenly feeling cold.<h5 class=pad-bot-m>Significant physical changes.</h5><p class=pad-bot-m>The concept of “a minute on your lip, a lifetime on your hip” comes to reality. Eating one slice of cake for dinner could increase weight around our waist and abdominal region, with a reduction in our metabolic rate."<p class=pad-bot-m>It is also common to notice our hair and skin becoming drier and thinner; no amount of conditioner and lotion seem to absolutely solve this problem.</p><a href=https://www.betterbody.co/pages/pp-provitalize-m target=_blank class=pad-bot-m>Say goodbye to unwanted weight gain due to menopause.</a></article><article id=postmenopause><h3 class="pad-bot-m pad-top-m">Postmenopause</h3><p class=pad-bot-m>Yes, the troubles don’t end right at menopause. It is the stage where most of the severe menopausal symptoms decrease but it comes with additional side effects.<h4 class=pad-bot-m>What happens?</h4><h5 class=pad-bot-m>Increase in Follicle Stimulating Hormones (FSH)</h5><p class=pad-bot-m>This increases dramatically as our ovaries shut down and drastically lower the level of estrogen in our body.<p class=pad-bot-m>By this point, we started noticing a lowered energy level - sleeping in by 7/8 P.M. after work is a norm.<h5 class=pad-bot-m>Higher risk of certain health conditions.</h5><p class=pad-bot-m>Some of the common health problems that occur during postmenopause are diabetes, joint pains, osteoporosis, cholesterol and heart disease.<p class=pad-bot-m>This could be an alarming phase, where every visit to the doctor is like drawing a lottery ticket- we need to maintain a healthy lifestyle to combat such possibilities.<h5 class=pad-bot-m>Difficulty concentrating and memory lapses (often temporary)</h5><p class=pad-bot-m>Forgetting your car keys, deadlines seem to increase over time. However, these are temporary symptoms of postmenopause.<p class=pad-bot-m>We face a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factors which could also cause depression and anxiety. Now we have identified the 3 stages of Menopause.<p class=pad-bot-m>Understanding the 3 most common symptoms amongst women is vital, allowing us to solve or reduce these problems.<ol class=ordered-inline-list><li>Hot Flashes & Night Sweats<li>Bloating & Weight Gain<li>Joint Pains & Anxiety/Depression</ol></article></div></section><section class="row pad-bot-l pad-top-l"id=menopause-treatments><div class=col><h2 class=pad-bot-m>Natural treatments</h2><p class=pad-bot-m>Going through menopause by yourself is hard!
